# Accessing Blockchain Data

## Covalent_API_Block_Height: 
We intend to utilize the Covalent API, which yields a JSON response that we subsequently transform into a dataframe. We navigate through the data by scrutinizing specific columns and constructing various data frames. This approach serves as a means not only to grasp the process of transforming a JSON response into a dataframe but also to acquaint ourselves with the data associated with the 'get block' endpoint.

## Data_Web3&Alchemy:
Web3 library to access and retrieve data from the blockchain. Web3 is a Python library that enables interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. It serves as a bridge between your Python scripts and the Ethereum network, allowing you to query information, send transactions, and perform various operations on the blockchain. Alchemy, on the other hand, is a powerful infrastructure provider for blockchain developers. Leveraging Alchemy's API can enhance your Web3 experience by providing reliable and scalable access to the Ethereum network.

# About the Project
