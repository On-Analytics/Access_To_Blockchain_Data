Accessing Blockchain Data
We intend to utilize the Covalent API, which yields a JSON response that we subsequently transform into a dataframe. We navigate through the data by scrutinizing specific columns and constructing various data frames. This approach serves as a means not only to grasp the process of transforming a JSON response into a dataframe but also to acquaint ourselves with the data associated with the 'get block' endpoint.
